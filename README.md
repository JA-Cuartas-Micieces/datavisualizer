
PROJECT

The project was developed as a personal project to work as a data visualizer and database builder written in python (v3.7-Anaconda).
The original idea was to make a simple Case Report Form to help with data visualization and management in little projects. It has been tested in Windows 10 OS but It will probably work in others as well.
It takes csv files as an input and the database model, the plot which is shown in the main window and the mining table can be easily adapted to your needs.

MODULES AND "INSTALLATION"

Since there is not an executable file, you must install python first (It was developed in python version 3.7) and use it to execute the file Templates.py to open the GUI.
You can find some examples (miningtb.csv, individuos.csv and seguimiento.csv) to learn how the program works through trial and error.
The main module is Templates.py and it consists of two classes, Db and MainWindow. Db contains all the methods and attributes to work with the sqlite database and MainWindow is the user interface.
miningtb.py and graphs.py can be easily accessed through the Edit button in the main menu to configure the images shown, and the mining table output.

CONTACT AND CONTRIBUTION

It is a personal project which is not open for contributions at the moment but please, feel free to share any comments, questions or suggestions through javiercuartasmicieces@hotmail.com.
